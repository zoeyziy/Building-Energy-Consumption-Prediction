# Building-Energy-Consumption-Prediction
## Overview
- Implemented models to predict building energy consumption based on linear regression and LightGBM in Python
- Reduced dataset dimensionality while retaining at least 80% of variability in the given weather features by PCA
- Achieved a minimum RMSLE of 0.66 using the LightGBM model with lag and window features
